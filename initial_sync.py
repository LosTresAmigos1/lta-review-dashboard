"""
initial_sync.py -- Multi-Tenant Phase 4G: the FIRST real Google Business
Profile synchronization for a newly provisioned BLOB tenant. Takes a
tenant from 'provisioned' (Phase 4F/4F.1: durable, verified, EMPTY
reviews.db + private-data artifacts exist in Vercel Blob) through
'initial_sync' to 'active' -- the ONLY status tenants.js's
tenantOwnsLocationCatalog() authorizes, and the ONLY transition this file
is allowed to make (see tenantConfigStore.js's isValidStatus() comment and
tests/test_provisioned_not_active.js's structural assertion).

STATE MACHINE:
    provisioned / initial_sync_failed --> initial_sync --> active (success)
                                                        --> initial_sync_failed (failure)

A tenant sitting at 'initial_sync' itself is NOT a valid retry starting
point for a NEW invocation -- that would mean a run is already (or was
recently) in flight. This phase does not build a stuck-run watchdog for
Initial Sync (unlike provider_sync.py's reconcile_stuck_runs() for ordinary
scraper_runs); a tenant stuck at 'initial_sync' after a crashed worker
requires a reviewed manual intervention, not an automatic reset, since
this file's own CAS discipline (below) is what guarantees a truly stale
attempt can never publish itself as successful regardless.

WHY REUSE, NOT REWRITE, THE GOOGLE SYNC PIPELINE: sync_reviews.py already
proves the exact pattern this file needs -- bind db.DB_PATH to one
tenant's own database, build a tenant-scoped GBPProvider, call
provider_sync.sync_all(), and trust its own location-linking/dedup-upsert/
run-bookkeeping logic completely unchanged. The ONE adaptation required is
tenant_approved_locations_provider.ApprovedLocationsOnlyGBPProvider, which
narrows GBPProvider.discover_locations() to exactly this tenant's
approvedLocations before provider_sync.py's linking logic ever sees the
result -- see that module's header for why this alone is sufficient to
guarantee no new/unapproved location can ever be created or synced,
without touching provider_sync.py's or gbp_sync.py's production logic at
all (Los Tres Amigos's own sync path is completely untouched by this file).

BLOB LIFECYCLE (reviews.db): mirrors provision_tenant.py's reconciliation
path exactly, reusing the SAME primitives (tenant_blob_store.head_blob/
get_blob/put_blob, the SAME BlobPreconditionFailedError-based optimistic
concurrency): read the current ETag, verify it matches tenant_config's own
recorded provisioning.reviewDbEtag (a defensive check against Blob having
been tampered with or drifted out of band -- never trusted implicitly),
download, sync, then upload the replacement with `if_match=<the ETag just
read>`. A worker that started from an older generation can never overwrite
a newer one -- Blob's own conditional-write mechanism rejects it atomically
(see tenant_blob_store.py's header), converted here to
StaleInitialSyncAttemptError.

ARTIFACT PUBLICATION (generation-versioned, per this phase's explicit
design): reuses tenant_artifact_export.generate_tenant_artifacts() (itself
a thin wrapper over export_chunks.py's own real, production export
functions -- never a second, duplicated computation) to build the complete
artifact set from the freshly-synced database, uploads EVERY file under a
single, brand-new generation id
(tenant_blob_keys.generation_private_data_blob_key --
tenant-data/{tenantId}/generations/{generation}/private-data/...), verifies
the upload, and ONLY THEN lets the final activation CAS point
tenant_config's provisioning.artifactGeneration at it. Node's
reviewDataPaths.js reads exclusively through that recorded pointer -- a
reader can never observe a mix of an old and a new sync's artifacts,
because the old generation's objects are simply never referenced again
once the pointer moves (and are left in place, harmlessly orphaned, if the
pointer never moves at all -- e.g. this attempt fails before the final
CAS).

CONCURRENCY -- TWO independent CAS guarantees, exactly like
provision_tenant.py's Phase 4F.1 design:
  (a) tenant_config's own configVersion CAS -- every write after the
      initial read is checked against `expected_version`, chained by +1
      after each of this run's own successful writes. A stale write raises
      ConfigVersionConflictError, converted to StaleInitialSyncAttemptError.
  (b) the reviews.db Blob object's own ETag, enforced natively by Vercel
      Blob's conditional-write support -- a stale upload raises
      BlobPreconditionFailedError, ALSO converted to
      StaleInitialSyncAttemptError.
Either failing means this attempt's work is simply never published as the
tenant's authoritative state -- an orphaned local temp file is discarded,
an orphaned successful-but-unconfirmed Blob upload (database OR artifact
generation) is left in place, unpublished. A fresh retry re-reads current
state from scratch and starts over; because provider_sync.py's own
review-upsert is dedup-key-based, re-running Google sync against an
ALREADY-synced database (the case after "DB uploaded but process died
before activation") is safe and idempotent -- it produces the identical
review set, never duplicates, and correctly picks up anything genuinely
new since the interrupted attempt.

         START, chained +1 after every one of this run's own successful
         writes -- see CONCURRENCY in this file's header).

         changed the database in the meantime.
