"""
provision_tenant.py -- Multi-Tenant Phase 4F (revised in Phase 4F.1 for
durable Blob-backed storage): creates the review-storage resources (a
per-tenant reviews.db + private-data JSON artifacts, both stored in Vercel
Blob) a tenant needs before Phase 4G's Initial Sync can write real reviews
into them.

WHY BLOB, NOT A LOCAL FILESYSTEM DIRECTORY (Phase 4F.1): Phase 4F originally
built this under a local directory (tenant_paths.PROVISIONED_TENANTS_ROOT).
A dedicated production-persistence audit then proved that design cannot
survive in production: this script runs on an ephemeral GitHub Actions
runner, the dashboard API runs on Vercel serverless Node, and Python's GBP
sync workers run on yet another ephemeral runner -- none of these share a
filesystem, and nothing in the existing CI/CD pipeline ever commits or
deploys a tenant-data directory anywhere. Vercel Blob (already a real,
wired-in dependency of this project -- see dashboard/api/_lib/blobStore.js)
is a genuinely durable, network-accessible store reachable from all three
environments, so it replaces the local directory entirely for every tenant
this script provisions. Los Tres Amigos is NOT migrated by this change --
it keeps its existing git-committed reviews.db/private-data, storageMode
'LEGACY_REPO', and is never provisioned via this script at all.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: sync any reviews from Google. That is Initial Sync
(Phase 4G, not built here) -- explicitly blocked until this durable storage
layer is complete. This script's only job is to bring a tenant from
"locations approved" (tenant_config's approvedLocations/locationIdMap,
written by google/[action].js's approveLocations()) to "has a real,
verified, empty reviews.db and private-data artifacts durably stored in
Vercel Blob, with its locations table pre-populated at the exact stable
numeric ids already reserved for it" -- i.e. a safe place for Initial Sync
to write into later, never fabricated review data.

TRUSTED INPUT ONLY: tenant_id is validated (tenant_keys.assert_valid_tenant_id)
before anything else runs, and every Blob key this script touches is
computed exclusively by tenant_blob_keys.py's deterministic formula over
that validated tenant_id -- never a key built by interpolating request input
into some other pattern. Only a tenant whose tenant_config record has
storageMode == 'BLOB' is ever provisioned here; any other value (LEGACY_REPO,
or a future mode this script doesn't understand) is a hard, fail-closed
refusal (UnsupportedStorageModeError) -- this script must never guess at or
silently "adapt to" a storage mode it wasn't explicitly built for.

STABLE LOCATION IDS: unchanged from Phase 4F -- every location's numeric
`locations.id` comes EXCLUSIVELY from tenant_config's locationIdMap
(googleLocationId -> locationId, permanent, allocated once, never
reassigned) via an explicit `INSERT INTO locations (id, ...)`, never
SQLite's own AUTOINCREMENT, never array position, never discovery/
alphabetical order. Every approvedLocations entry is cross-checked against
locationIdMap for consistency BEFORE any Blob I/O -- a missing/duplicate/
conflicting mapping fails closed with nothing uploaded at all.

CONCURRENCY, REVISED FOR BLOB (Phase 4F.1): the tenant_config record itself
is still protected exactly as in Phase 4F's closure -- every write after the
initial read is a CAS via `expected_version` (see tenant_config_store.py).
NEW in this phase: the reviews.db Blob object has its OWN, independent
concurrency guarantee, because two different pieces of state can each be
raced against (the tenant_config record, AND the Blob object's actual bytes)
and both must be protected, not just the former. This uses Vercel Blob's
NATIVE conditional-write support (confirmed directly against the installed
@vercel/blob@2.8.0 SDK's own type definitions and request-building code --
see tenant_blob_store.py's header): every reviews.db upload either supplies
`allow_overwrite=False` (no Blob may exist yet at that key -- the correct
guard for this tenant's very FIRST upload, catching a racing first writer)
or `if_match=<the ETag most recently read from Blob>` (the correct guard for
a later, reconciling upload -- catching any writer that started from a
generation someone else has since superseded). Vercel Blob itself, not
Redis and not application code, is the single atomic authority for "did the
database change since I looked" -- there is no read-then-write window in
this script for a second writer to race into, because the check and the
write are the SAME request to Blob's storage layer.

IDEMPOTENCY / PARTIAL-FAILURE RECOVERY: see provision_tenant()'s own
docstring below for the full state machine. Summary: fresh work happens
entirely against a local temp directory (never uploaded until fully built
and verified), uploaded to Blob only once verified, and tenant_config is
only ever confirmed 'provisioned' AFTER every upload succeeds. An
interruption at any point before the final tenant_config CAS write leaves
the tenant NOT provisioned (any partial Blob uploads are simply orphaned,
inert objects a fresh attempt will overwrite or ignore -- never mistaken for
a real tenant's authoritative state, since tenant_config's own recorded
reviewDbBlobKey/status is what every reader actually trusts, not "does a
Blob object happen to exist"). A retry against a tenant whose reviews.db
Blob already exists and is fully consistent with the current
approvedLocations is a safe, cheap no-op. A retry that finds an EMPTY (zero
real reviews) database missing only newly-approved locations safely adds
just those rows via a download-modify-reupload-with-if_match cycle. A
database that already contains real review data is NEVER touched by this
script under any circumstances, consistent or not -- provisioning existing,
live tenants is explicitly out of scope for this phase.

          function's own successful writes. A stale write raises
          ConfigVersionConflictError, converted to
          StaleProvisioningAttemptError here.
      (b) the reviews.db Blob object's own ETag, enforced natively by Vercel
          Blob's conditional-write support (see tenant_blob_store.py's
          header) -- a worker that read ETag E can only successfully write a
          new version if the Blob's current ETag is STILL E at the moment of
          the write (single atomic request, no read-then-write window).
          A stale write raises BlobPreconditionFailedError, ALSO converted
          to StaleProvisioningAttemptError here.
    Either guarantee failing means this attempt's work (if any) is simply
    not published as the tenant's authoritative state -- an orphaned local
    temp file is discarded, an orphaned successful-but-unconfirmed Blob
    upload is left in place, unpublished (tenant_config's own recorded
    reviewDbBlobKey/status is what every reader trusts, never "does a Blob
    object happen to exist"). A later, fresh call to provision_tenant()
    re-reads current state and reconciles correctly (see step 4) rather than
    trusting anything this run computed.
