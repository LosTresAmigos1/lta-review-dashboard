    directly whenever the result identifies a SPECIFIC location (a file
    path, a cache key, an alert id) rather than merely being displayed.

    `id_to_name`: {locationId: displayName} for one tenant's full,
    CURRENT location set (never a subset -- collisions can only be
    detected against the complete set a given export/sync run is
    operating on). Returns {locationId: slug}.

    A location's own bare slugify(name) is used whenever no OTHER
    location in this exact set shares it. A name shared by 2+ locations
    gets ITS OWN numeric locationId appended (e.g. "los-tres-amigos-14")

    primary key / tenantConfigStore.js's locationIdMap-assigned id) --
    NEVER array position, iteration order, or anything random, so calling
    this again with the same location set always produces the same
    mapping, deterministically, regardless of dict ordering.

    Stability note: a location's slug is a function of the CURRENT full
    location set, not of history -- if a same-named sibling is added
    later (an entitlement change), a previously-bare slug can become
    disambiguated on the next full artifact regeneration. This is safe:
    slug is never a persisted or user-bookmarked identifier anywhere in
    this codebase (no frontend route reads it from a URL) -- only an
    internal artifact-file-name/cache-key, always re-read fresh from the
    current meta.json on every load.

    A name with no alphanumeric characters at all (rare, but not
    impossible -- e.g. a title that's pure punctuation/emoji) slugifies to
    an empty string; that base is replaced with "location-{id}" BEFORE the
    collision check below, so no artifact/cache key is ever written under
    an empty or bare-numeric-looking path."""

    its own id -- used by gbp_import.py's reconciliation pass once it has
    matched a scraped row to an API review, since routing that through
    upsert_review()/dedup_key() would look the row up by gbp_review_name
    (which doesn't exist on it yet) and insert a duplicate instead of
    updating the row that was actually matched.

    Invariant this function exists to uphold: whenever gbp_review_name is
    non-null on a row, dedup_key MUST equal it -- gbp_review_name is the
    canonical identity for any GBP-linked review, and dedup_key is only ever
    an independently-meaningful value for rows that don't have one yet.
    Both columns are set in the same UPDATE statement so the row can never
    be observed in a state where they've diverged (the exact production
    incident this invariant was added to prevent: a row linked here without
    also updating dedup_key looked, to a later upsert_review() call, like a
    brand new review sharing another row's gbp_review_name -- a duplicate
    insert attempt that violated the partial UNIQUE index).

    owner_response (production incident, 2026-07-28): the caller already has
    this -- the same API review object that yields gbp_review_name also
    carries reviewReply.comment, if any -- but this function previously
    discarded it, linking gbp_reply_update_time (reply METADATA) onto the row
    while leaving owner_response (the reply TEXT) at whatever the scraper had
    captured, usually empty. Every consumer of "is this replied" reads
    owner_response, never gbp_reply_update_time, so this silently produced
    reviews Google shows as replied that the dashboard, alerts, and digest
    all still treat as unanswered -- confirmed against production data (77
    rows, some alerted as unanswered for over a year after Google's own
    reply timestamp). Uses the same blank-never-erases rule upsert_review()
    applies: a blank/absent incoming value preserves whatever this row
    already had, it never blanks out a previously-captured reply.

    Deliberately NOT fabricated the other direction either: if the caller
    passes a gbp_reply_update_time with no owner_response (Google recorded a
    reply update time but the comment came back empty -- an anomaly, not a
    real absence of a reply), this function stores exactly that:
    gbp_reply_update_time set, owner_response left as whatever it already
    was (usually still empty). It does not mark the review replied, and it
    does not invent reply text. That combination -- gbp_reply_update_time
    IS NOT NULL AND owner_response empty -- is exactly the predicate
    reconcile_gbp_replies.py's reconciliation utility looks for; this
    function's job is to store the truth, not to paper over the anomaly."""
