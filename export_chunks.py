"""
export_chunks.py - Export Agent (Milestone 3).

Reads dashboard/reviews.db and writes a set of small, purpose-built JSON
files into dashboard/private-data/ -- a directory OUTSIDE dashboard/public/,
so Vercel never serves these files as static assets. The frontend reaches
them only through the authenticated dashboard/api/data/[...path].js
endpoint (session-gated, path-allowlisted), not by direct fetch().

This directory was dashboard/public/data/ until raw review content, AI
sentiment/priority fields, and other operational data were found to be
reachable by anyone who guessed the URL -- see README "Standing rule:
sensitive data must never be written into a publicly served directory".
Do not add a new export target under dashboard/public/ for anything beyond
truly public, anonymous-safe assets (icons, manifest, etc).

Most of the heavy aggregation (KPIs, trends, location stats, rankings,
insights) is already computed by refresh_analytics.py into analytics_cache
-- this script just dumps those plus raw per-location review rows (for
ReviewExplorer/LocationDetail) and a few derived views (action items,
scraper status, validation summary) the frontend still needs in row form
rather than pre-aggregated form.
